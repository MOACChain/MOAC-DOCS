What is MOAC?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MOAC is a revolutionary platform with a Multi-Blockchain smart contract
and P2P service network to efficiently build and scale decentralized
applications. By leveraging Multi-Blockchain sharding, the MOAC platform
increases system capacity and performance, reduces transaction fees for
smart contracts, and incentivizes mobile and desktop users to compete
for processing rewards.

The platform is a Multi-Blockchain software and deployment service
solution for rapid development of decentralized applications (Dapps) and
smart contracts on a scalable P2P service network. By using an advanced
layered architecture for asynchronous smart contracts and a variety of
configurable consensus systems (including “proof of work” and “proof of
stake”), the MOAC platform enhances existing Dapps with additional
functionality, and scalability solutions. This advancement increases
processing speed by several levels of magnitude (10-100x) and sets a new
market standard for transactional efficiency, while optimizing
decentralization mechanisms and overall security.

What is MOAC for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MOAC platform was designed to increase and maximize blockchain
network performance using node-based computing power and allowing for
on-demand, timed, and savable smart contract processing. The platform
provides tools and APIs to application developers to quickly build
complex Dapps that can leverage both “proof of work” and “proof of
stake” and other scalable consensus systems on a decentralized P2P
service network. In turn, and as a result of increased volume and speed
of processing, the new MotherChain standard incentivizes the user
community and drives increased participation - including users with low
processing power (i.e., mobile users).

Why was MOAC created?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Existing blockchain technologies and platforms suffer from steep
learning curves, unnecessary complexity, and high usage fees all of
which impact adoption and scalability. Technically, existing platforms
have low transactions-per-second, have fixed consensus models, and are
not able to quickly adapt to the ever growing needs of developers. These
blockchain platforms are also alienated from each other, and unable to
communicate effectively with other cryptocurrencies, smart contracts,
and blockchain systems, creating a highly segregated blockchain
marketplace. To make matters even more complicated, most blockchains are
difficult to upgrade, and split participation inefficiently between
users.

MOAC has addressed the primary inefficiencies of existing blockchain
platforms by developing a Multi-Blockchain architecture that lowers
Dapps costs, provides for scalability, and reduces development
complexity while also increasing transaction speeds and volume using
sharding. MOAC leverages multiple blockchains within its platform,
including MotherChain (Proof of Work), a Dapp Chain (Proof of Stake or
any other consensus protocol, see below sections) for scalable
transactions, Microchains for Smart Contracts, and Cross-Chain
capabilities for interacting between multiple blockchains and
cryptocurrencies for improved efficiency, and scalability.

By separating balance transfer and smart contracts, the MOAC Platform
can outperform Ethereum by 100x transactions per second using an
advanced Mutli-blockchain system including Microchains and sharding.

Why is MOAC so much better for DAPPs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, MOAC uses blockchain sharding to speed up the TPS, making it an
attractive platform for DAPP developers and users.

Secondly, it redefines how DAPP developers and users interact with the
system from the monetization standpoint. Most existing systems assume
unfair burden on DAPP users: not only DAPP do they have to pay each
transaction fee, but they also have a steep learning curve to climb on
how blockchain works. With MOAC, there is no need to know anything about
the underlying system before using the DAPP, and no need to acquire any
underlying token unless the use case itself really commands it.

Thirdly, MOAC adds new ways to redistribute tokens to a wide range of
participants, thus further supporting decentralization. Thanks to the
second layer’s mining, each DAPP will pay its miners continuously all
throughout the lifetime of the DAPP. And because the second layer’s
mining does not need to calculate a random number, every CPU (including
mobile devices) can participate as potential nodes. This greatly
encourages participants in masses to provide the processing power to
support more DAPPs and get incentivized accordingly.

Finally, since DAPPs are deployed in a virtual machine of the
developer’s choice, they do not require additional programming. MOAC is
able to run existing Ethereum smart contracts with lower fees, and
developers can leverage the MOAC API to expand their existing smart
contract with additional functionality without having to learn how to
program on the blockchain.

How to get MOAC?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MOAC's mainnet was released on April 30th, 2018. Now you can get MOAC on
the mainnet through the following options:

1. User can mined the MOAC out using the released go client.
2. If you have any ERC20 token, you can also exchange your ERC20 token
   to Moac on the mainnet by contacting .
3. Exchange MOAC with other crypto-tokens: There are several exchanges
   that currently listed MOAC. You can find more info on `this
   link <https://www.feixiaohao.com/currencies/moac/>`__.

If you want some moac on the testnet, you can mine on the testnet, put
your receiver address
`here <https://github.com/MOACChain/moac-core/issues/1>`__ or contact
the `MOAC team <info@moac.io>`__.
