Blockchain general terms
==========================


- **51% Attack**: An attack on the distributed ledger that results in miners group has controlled more than 50% of the mining hash rate of the network. The term “Attack,” is used mostly in context to Bitcoin.

- **Address**: Refers to a string of alphanumeric characters or scannable QR code, which is used to transmit and receive transactions on the network. The address is an essential term in the cryptocurrency, generated using the private key.

- **Airdrop**: means distributing the free tokens to stakeholders as rewards. Airdrop is related to the blockchain projects, especially ICOs. Also, it might or might not include an incentive. Many blockchain projects perform airdrop for various reasons like community growth, fixing the bugs or incentivize a positive effort towards their idea.

- **Accidental Fork**: happens when two or more miners select the block simultaneously. Then, one chain becomes longer than other. Also, the network abandons blocks that are not included in the long chain. These blocks are referred to as “orphaned blocks.”

- **Agreement Ledger**: is considered as distributed ledger (DL), where two or more parties use it to negotiate and reach an agreement.

- **ASIC**: stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit, also referred to Silicon Chip is created to do a single task with significant power savings. ASICs are more efficient as compared to conventional hardware like CPU and GPU. ASIC is designed to process SHA-256 hashing problems for mining more bitcoins.

- **API**: Application Programming Interface (API) is referred to be a software intermediary that enables two different applications to interact with each other. These interfaces define ways to do communication between several components.
Attestation Ledger is an account book, created to provide evidence of individual transactions. The ledger is to used to check that agreement, statement or commitment of transaction was made.

- **Bitcoin**: Capital ‘B’ in Bitcoin: refers to the Bitcoin network

- **bitcoin**: Lowercase ‘b’ in bitcoin: refers to the token/cryptocurrency bitcoin

- **Blockchain**: a distributed ledger that comprises of immutable records. Each block is then linked to the next block with a cryptographic signature. It enables block chains to be used like a ledger that can be shared and accessed by anyone having the right permissions. The blockchain is the transparent ledger that is used to save identities, value, agreements, credentials and property rights. Once you add something to the ledger, it will stay there forever.

- **Central Ledger**: The ledger, which is maintained by the central agency. Chain linking: It is the process to connect two blockchains so that transactions between the chain could take place. Blockchain like bitcoin can communicate with other side chains by enabling the assets exchange between them.

- **Confirmation**: means the transactions occurred on the blockchain has been verified by the network. It happens through a process called mining in P-O-W system. When a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be double spent or reversed. As much as confirmations the transaction has, the harder it becomes to make a double spend attack.

- **Consensus Process**: is achieved when all the network participants agree on the validity of the transactions and ensure that ledgers are correctly copied with each other.

- **Cryptocurrency**: A digital currency that is based on mathematics, where encryption techniques regulate the units of currency and verify the fund’s transfer. Also, cryptocurrencies are the representations of digital assets. Some of the popular cryptocurrencies are EOS, Bitcoin, NEO, Litecoin and Ethereum. Network stakeholders can buy or mine the cryptocurrency. Also, there are more ways to get hold of them including airdrop, staking or bounties.

- **Consortium Blockchain**: is a blockchain, where a pre-selected set of nodes handles consensus process. It is also called permissioned blockchain network that can be a hybrid model built between trusted entity model of private blockchains and low trust provided by the public blockchain. In this, the access to read the transactions can be public or restricted to the participants. Moreover, these types of blockchains may be referred to as “partially decentralized.”

- **Cryptoanalysis**: The thesis of methods for understanding the meaning of the encrypted details, without accessing the secret details.

- **Cryptojacking**: is considered as a secret use of a device for mining cryptocurrency.

In the flush operation, MicroChain will give out the mining rewards to the SCS miners, deposit/withdraw MicroChain tokens, and other transactions that may change the status in the MotherChain. 

- **Fork**: builds an alternative blockchain version by allowing two blocks to run simultaneously on different parts of the network. Forks generally happen in the crypto-world when new ‘governance rules’ are built into the blockchain’s code. It creates two parallel blockchains, where one among the two is the winning blockchain.
