Airdrop means distributing the free tokens_ to stakeholders as rewards. Airdrop is related to the blockchain projects, especially ICOs. Also, it might or might not include an incentive. Many blockchain projects perform airdrop for various reasons like community growth, fixing the bugs or incentivize a positive effort towards their idea.

.. _Accidental Fork:

**Accidental Fork** |br| 
An Accidental Fork happens when two or more miners select the block simultaneously. Then, one chain becomes longer than other. Also, the network abandons blocks that are not included in the long chain. These blocks are referred to as “`orphan blocks`_.” |br| *→ See also:* Fork_

.. _agreement ledger:

**Agreement Ledger** |br| 
An agreement ledger is considered as a `distributed ledger`_ (DL), where two or more parties use it to negotiate and reach an agreement.

.. _Asymmetric Cryptography:

**Asymmetric Cryptography (Public Key Cryptography)** |br|
Asymmetric cryptography, is also known as public key cryptography. It uses public keys and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. The keys are large numbers that have been paired together but are not identical (asymmetric). A `public key`_ can be shared with everyone. The `private key`_ in the pair is kept secret. Protocols such as SSH, S/MIME rely on asymmetric cryptography for encryption_ and `digital signature`_ functions.
