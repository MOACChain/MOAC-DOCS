Checking the Balance of Your Account
====================================

You only need your public wallet address in order to see your balance.
It is not recommended that you access your wallet by entering your
private key anywhere if you just want to check the balance or see
incoming or outgoing transactions. The fewer times that you need to open
your wallet, the better.
