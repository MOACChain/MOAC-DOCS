^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Go to https://www.moacwalletonline.com/#generate-wallet .

Enter a strong but easy to remember password.

Click the "Create New Wallet" button.

Click the "Download" button & save your Keystore / UTC file. Back it up.

Read the warning. If you understand it and promise not to lose your
private key, click the "I understand. Continue" button.

You now have the option of printing a paper wallet, saving your private
key, or saving a QR code of your private key. Back up at least one
(offline).

Then click "Next: Save your Address"

Unlock your wallet that you just created using the Keystore / UTC file
you just downloaded or the private key.

Ensure all information matches. Don't lose this information. Double
check your work. Don't be dumb.
