MicroChain Users
----------------


There are three types of users in MicroChains:

-  A、 SCS miner：run SCS and join the MicroChain consensus to get
   MicroChain rewards;
-  B、 DAPP developer：develop DAPP and deploy its Smart Contract on the
   MicroChain；
-  C、 VNODE proxy：provide a VNODE-PROXY to MicroChain.

In the MOAC ecosystem, these players have different responsibility and
rewards:

-  A. SCS miner: A SCS miner needs to deposit some MOAC to join a
   MicroChain mining pool. When a SCS was chosen by one MicroChain and
   start mining, it can receive MicroChain mining rewards as long as the
   MicroChain is running. The rewards usually was given as MOAC and
   shows up after a flush of the MicroChain. The deposit will be
   deducted if the SCS keeps sending dishonest transactions or lost
   connections very often.

-  B. DAPP developer: When the DAPP developer deploy his Contract on the
   MicroChain, he need to deposit enough MOAC to pay the SCS miners for
   their work. These MOAC will be distributed to the SCSs after each
   MicroChain block generated, and saved to the MotherChain after
   MicroChain flush.

-  C. VNODE proxy: Need to pay deposit to register as proxy. It can get
   rewards from participting in the MicroChain and from transfer data of
   MicroChains.

For the details of the deposit amount and how to get rewards, please
refer to the smart contracts defined them:

1. subchainprotocolbase
2. subchainbase
3. vnodeprotocolbase

We suggested the users use official pools for our testing, so we can
find bugs and problems in the testnet. In the future, users can form
their own pools and benefit from them.
