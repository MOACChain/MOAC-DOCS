ICO
~~~

The crowdsale of MOAC happened in June 2017. There are total 75,000,000 MOAC used in the ICO. Total 56,483,386 MOAC was
sold during the ICO time and the rest is held in private investors.

MOAC tokens can also be mineable, so mining is a viable alternative if
you want to have the tokens. At first you will be able to be rewarded
with 2 MOAC tokens per block but this number will decrease by half
whenever 12,500,000 MOAC tokens have been already mined.
